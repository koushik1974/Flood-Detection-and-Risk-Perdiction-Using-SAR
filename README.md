# Flood-Detection-and-Risk-Perdiction-Using-SAR
This project uses pre- and post-flood SAR satellite images to analyze water spread patterns and identify flood-prone areas. By learning from past flood data, the model predicts which regions are most likely to be affected in future flood waves, aiding early warning and disaster management.
